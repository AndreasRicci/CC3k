NOTES

- This was a project for CS246 Object-Oriented Software Development at the University of Waterloo, created as a partnership with Alex Truong.
- It is written in C++ and is compatible with Linux and OS X.
- It was created on a strict (and short) timeline, so there are many improvements which could be made.
- Many libraries and other tools were disallowed, so some grunt work is evident.

- See "Project Specifications" for more information about this project.
